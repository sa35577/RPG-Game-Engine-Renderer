Final Summative Evaluation for Grade 12 Computer Science. This application allows you to custom build your own game and then run it.

It was made using Java, and allows users to create both top-down and platform style games. This was inspired by "GameStar Mechanic", a website I myself used to make games for a storyline several years back.
